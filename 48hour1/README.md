# Web-Script Programming
## Coursework Challenge 1 (ws_cwk1)

Welcome to the first coursework for the Web Script Programming unit.  This folder contains all the challenges that you must try to complete.

This is an individual coursework, so whilst you are allowed to discuss both the challenges _and_ the approaches you might take to tackling them, all work must be your own.

## Scenario

The scenario is that we're building a web-based game, and you're joining the development team.  The game is not finished, but we have a basic framework working.

To help you get up to speed with the framework we've stripped out a few bits of code and want you to add them back in so that everything works.  Once you've achieved this you'll be ready to start developing with the rest of the team.

Unit tests are in the same format that you have completed week on week.  For this cousework they're in the file `assess.cwk1.js`.  To run the unit tests you should open `index.html`, as usual.  To see the framework for the game without the unit test harness open `game.html`.  In that page, different panels can be toggled on and off with the `D`, `L` and `P` keys. The position of the mouse sets the direction you are traveling in an empty space.




## Submission / Upload
When you have completed all the tests to the best of your ability, upload your `index.js` file to the dropbox on moodle.
